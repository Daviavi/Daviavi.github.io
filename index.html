    <p>
        "25-ji, Nightcord de.", often abbreviated as 25-ji, N25, and Niigo (ニーゴ), is an online music circle that makes songs at 25:00 (1:00 AM),
         present in the mobile rhythm videogame "Hatsune Miku: Colorful Stage" (a.k.a. Project Sekai).
         The circle was created by Kanade (K) in hopes of making music that "saves people" and gives them hope.
         She recruits the members Ena (Enanan), Mizuki (Amia), and Mafuyu (Yuki), communicating through a chat tool called "Nightcord."
         One day, Kanade loses contact with one of her circle members. They find a song file named "Untitled" that is shared with each of them,
         and upon playing it, they are transported to the Empty SEKAI, a special place created from the members' feelings. This is also where they
         meet in person for the first time.
        <br><br>
        The music from Nightcord at 25:00 is generally melancholic and very intense, using dark lyrics not only to make people feel heard, but to also give
         hope and "save" them. Some of the most popular covers from Nightcord at 25:00 are <i>Bug</i>, <i>BAKENOHANA</i>, <i>Gehenna</i>,
         <i>Heat Abnormal</i>, <i>Hated by life</i>, and <i>Bitter Choco Decoration</i>.

         Though soft-spoken and introverted, she leads the group with kindness and unmatched dedication, often staying up late as a result.
         Kanade's favorite food is instant noodles cups, because they are easy to make and she lives a low energy life, though Honami
         helps her by preparing more nutritious food.

         She is the lyricist, going by the alias "Yuki" (雪, snow).
         Mafuyu was an ideal honor student, and was often seen as a "perfect" person with no flaws, until Mafuyu began losing her sense of self.
         This spawned the Empty SEKAI and its Hatsune Miku, whom Mafuyu developed a strong bond with. 
         During the search for her true self, she came into contact with Yoisaki Kanade, and later formed Nightcord at 25:00 along with Shinonome Ena and Akiyama Mizuki.
         In her second year, Mafuyu was in Class 2-B. In her third year, she moved into Class 3-B.
         Mafuyu is a member of the archery club at Miyamasuzaka, and serves as a class representative.

         However, noticing the changes in Mafuyu since they first met, Ena has resolved to look after her dear friend.
